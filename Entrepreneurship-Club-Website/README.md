# Entrepreneurship-Club-Website
Web Development Project, Brooklyn Technical High School.

Created this website for The Young Entrepreneurs Association in 11th grade. Notable features: slideshow in JS, navigation bar and design. 

This is also my first programming project. Delving into this inpired me to learn more about code.
